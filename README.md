# Welcome to BushidoTech - A Technology and Cybersecurity Blog and Personal Portfolio

#### About Me
BushidoTech is a moniker, chosen by myself to project a personal image of a dedicated autodidact in the field of technology and cybersecurity with a reverence for eastern philosophies and martial arts. To me, hacking is a martial Art and should be treated as such. What else do you call a skill which could bring great suffering or death to your opponents, or which could be used to defend and protect your friends? Martial arts are lifetime pursuits. Not only about aquiring martial techniques, but also about following a path of discipline and creativity. Regular practice can transform an otherwise alien concept into the lifeblood of your day to day activities. Like any martial art, Hacking is a path of self discipline, constant learning, curiousity, and practice. To live the life of a martial artist is to chose a structured path. A path of Kaizen - the concept of getting better at your chosen craft every day. This is what is necessary to make a difference in the modern landscape. 

This Blog will feature a record of my path as a hacker and martial artist. It will contain reflections on my practice, raw notes, and research reports as necessary. It may also contain reflections of popular culture, media, or physical martial arts.
